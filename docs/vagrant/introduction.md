# What is Vagrant
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

## What you will need

* Vagrant 2.0.1 or Vagrant 2.0.2 
* A built Vagrant Box [Building the image](../packer/building-the-image.md)
* A decent text editor
* Some knowledge about Packer, JSON and PowerShell
